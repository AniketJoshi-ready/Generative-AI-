# Generative-AI-
A collection of Generative AI projects showcasing applications like text generation, image synthesis, chatbots, and creative AI. Covers models such as GANs, VAEs, Transformers, and LLMs with end-to-end implementations in Python using TensorFlow and PyTorch.



# Generative AI Projects

This repository contains hands-on projects demonstrating the power of **Generative AI** using modern transformer-based models and large language models (LLMs). The aim is to showcase practical implementations of text generation, summarization, and intelligent assistants that run efficiently on local machines.

## 📌 Project

### 1. FLAN-T5 Summarizer & Q&A Assistant

* Developed a CPU-friendly **CLI application** for abstractive text summarization and context-aware question answering.
* Designed to process and summarize **local notes or documents** for quick insights.
* Implemented using **Hugging Face Transformers** with **Seq2Seq models** and **prompt engineering**.
* Provided cross-platform command-line interface with modular, clean code structure.
* Runs offline with **PyTorch**, ensuring portability without cloud dependency.
* Demonstrated strong LLM concepts including **tokenization, decoding strategies, inference optimization, and context grounding**.

**Tech Stack:** Python, Hugging Face Transformers, PyTorch, FLAN-T5, SentencePiece
**GitHub:** [Project Link](https://github.com/username/--------)
